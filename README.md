# **E-Commerce Back End**
![Github License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## **Description**

This project was the creation of a back-end environment for an E-Commerce business. This was done using mysql2, sequelize, express, dotenv and node.js. The goal was to be able to create products, categories for those products, and tags for those products and then tie them all together. The front-end was provided but all the models and routes needed to be filled out.
